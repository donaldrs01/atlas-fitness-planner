## Development Story

The journey of developing **Active Agenda** began as a collaborative effort during our end-of-term project in trimester 3. We wanted to create a comprehensive fitness web app that would assist users in achieving their health and wellness goals. Our vision was to provide a centralized platform where users could access workout templates, resources, and organizational tools.

### Initial Concept and Planning
From the outset, we focused on creating an intuitive user experience. We brainstormed features that would cater to various user needs, from fitness beginners to enthusiasts. Our project timeline was tight, prompting us to prioritize essential features for our first release.
